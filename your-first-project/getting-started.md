It's important to understand the structure of a project first. The project is divided into two main sections:

### Left pane

Contains the "content" of the project, including whatever the student has to read + the activities.

In the left pane, you can include activities, that are automatically graded. There are different activity types. Check [What is an activity?](what-is-an-activity.md) and [Activity Types](activity-types.md) for more.

### Right pane

Includes the "interactive lab", which is whatever is "executable" by the student. This should have almost NO content.

### Next on

Check the different [What is an activity?](what-is-an-activity.md) and [Activity Types](activity-types.md) available or how to create your first project from a Notebook.
