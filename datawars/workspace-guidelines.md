# Good Workspace Environment

## Communication Best Practices

### Primary Tools:
- We primarily use **Google Workspace** (Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets, etc.) for all official documentation, communication, and collaboration.
- **Slack** is our day-to-day communication tool, but it is not a formal platform for critical or permanent information. _Slack is informal; if anything is important, it must be documented in an email or stored in Google Workspace._
- **Discord** is completely unofficial. If you send anything in Discord, assume it will not be read by anyone.

### Managing Important Information:
- All crucial information—such as decisions, updates, or records—must live in a formal system (Google Docs, Google Drive, Gmail) to ensure transparency, traceability, and easy access.
- For **actionable tasks or project updates**, we use **Airtable**.

## Google Calendar Etiquette

### Using Google Calendar for Meetings:
- **Mandatory Meetings:** All scheduled meetings (weekly syncs, check-ins, team discussions) are **mandatory**.
- **Missed Meetings:** Missing a meeting without prior notice is unacceptable. If unable to attend, you **must notify** the organizer in advance with a valid reason.

## Meeting Preparedness & Responsibility
- **Webcam Policy:** All employees are expected to keep their webcams **ON** during meetings to foster engagement. Turning off your camera should be an exception, not the norm.
- **Audio Quality:** Clear and reliable audio is essential. Employees should verify their audio setup before meetings to ensure effective communication.
- **Environment Setup for Meetings:**
    - Ensure you are in a quiet, well-lit environment during meetings to minimize distractions.
    - Be mindful of background noise and visual clutter, as they can affect focus and professionalism during meetings.

> If you experience issues with your setup, **DataWars** can provide the necessary equipment (webcams, microphones, etc.). However, it is your responsibility to request assistance if needed.

# Who Should You Contact

Your first point of contact is **Anurag Verma** `averma@datawars.io`. You can escalate issues to **Santiago**, but only after Anurag has given approval or if you are not getting a response.
