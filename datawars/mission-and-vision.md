# DataWars Mission

DataWars mission is to complement the abundant learning material that is out there (youtube videos, books, blogs, free courses, etc) with real life projects.

Our type of customer is someone that wants to learn by doing and build experience with Data Science. They work/study full time. This is going to be important by the time we discuss about what makes a good project.
