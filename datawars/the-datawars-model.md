> A [!badge variant="info" text="Project"] in DataWars is always enclosed in [!badge variant="info" text="Skill"], which in turn is contained in a [!badge variant="info" text="Skill Track"]. Multiple [!badge variant="info" text="Skill Tracks"] are organized within a [!badge variant="info" text="Career Path"] based on their [!badge variant="secondary" text="Proficiency"] and [!badge variant="secondary" text="Learning Area"].


A [!badge variant="info" text="Skill"] denotes a single, atomic Skill that a user "has". For example, *"Dealing with null values"*, or *"Dealing with duplicate values"*. These [!badge variant="info" text="Skills"] are then logically aggregated in a [!badge variant="info" text="Skill Track"]. In this case, it'll be **"Data Cleaning"**.

[!badge variant="info" text="Skill Tracks"] are subjective aggregations that we have decided to create.

A [!badge variant="info" text="Career Path"] defines a "role" for a user, divided in multiple Learning Areas and Proficiencies. Within the juncture of Proficiency and Learning Area, you'll find a [!badge variant="info" text="Skill Track"].
