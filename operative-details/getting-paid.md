To get paid, you need to send an invoice of the previous month to `ap@datawars.io`.
The invoice has to be in US Dollars and contain your full name and instructions to get paid (your bank account details).

### Example:

```
Date: 01/08/2024
Subject: July 2024 invoice
Body:
Hello DataWars Team, attached you'll find the invoice for the work performed on July 2024.
```

The invoice should contain:

```
Date
Line items related to the role you were assigned
- Project Author
- Project QA
- etc
Amount in full in $USD
Instructions to get paid
```

### Proportional invoices

If you started on an odd date that is not the beginning of the month, you must send a proportional invoice for your services. So for example, if you started on September 15th, and your salary is $100/month, you should send on the first day of October an invoice for `$100/30 * 15`. Next month, you'll send a full invoice and go back to schedule.
