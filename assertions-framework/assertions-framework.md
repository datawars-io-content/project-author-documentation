# Assertion Framework Documentation

In this assertion framework documentation, you'll learn how to use already defined function to check/assert the activity.

This assertion framework documentation is divided into two parts, first part cover the most used assertion function with example activities which teach you how to save the expected result and then check it with users/student solution. Second part cover the not only how to use them but in more details like what are the parameters, what are the return types, etc.

> Make to use the same versions of required libraries as used in the platform. You can check the version of the library by running the following command in the notebook cell:

```python
import pandas as pd
pd.__version__
```

Similarly, you can check the version of other libraries like `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.
