This assertion framework documentation is divided into two parts, first part cover the most used assertion function with example activities which teach you how to save the expected result and then check it with users/student solution. Second part cover the not only how to use them but in more details like what are the parameters, what are the return types, etc.

```python
import pandas as pd
pd.__version__
```

Similarly, you can check the version of other libraries like `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.
