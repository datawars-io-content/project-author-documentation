DataWars' projects are all about creating interesting and engaging activities. An activity in general contains:

* **Title**: a short, descriptive, ideally imperative description of the objectives of the activity
* **Description**: A free text (unlimited) description to help the student achieve the objectives of the activity, can include images or videos.
* **Solution** (optional, strongly recommended): A solution that will be revealed upon request. Solutions can contain anything: text, code, images, GIFs, videos, etc. Although it's optional, MOST activities SHOULD contain a solution.
* **Hints** (optional): A series of hints that can help the user. Also can contain any type of text, images, etc.
* **Expected outcome** (optional): An example of what the outcome of the activity should be. It can be a screenshot of the dataframe, a table with the SQL results, an example of executing a function, etc.

There are different types of activities (read more in [Activity Types](activity-types.md)):

* Multiple choice
* Input
* Code/interactive with and without user input
